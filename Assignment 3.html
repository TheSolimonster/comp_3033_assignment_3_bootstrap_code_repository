        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hello and welcome to Khalid Soliman's Portfolio. My name is
            Khalid Soliman, and I am 22 years old. I am currently in my
            5th and final year at Acadia University, and I was born on
            November 2nd, 2002. I have four family members, excluding
            myself, and I am the youngest of three brothers. I am originally
            from Alexandria, Egypt, but I was born in Saudi Arabia and
            lived there until I turned 9. My family and I moved to Toronto,
            Canada, where I lived until I was 13. Afterward, I moved to
            Abu Dhabi, UAE, where I stayed until the age of 17, and finally
            settled in Wolfville, Nova Scotia, in 2020.
        </p>
        <p>
            Outside of school, I spend my time pursuing hobbies I enjoy.
            Some of these hobbies include playing football as an Offensive
            Lineman for Acadia University, playing video games, lifting
            weights, going on walks, and listening to music. I am proficient
            in two languages: English and Arabic. Additionally, I have
            beginner-level skills in two other languages: German and
            French. I take pride in stepping outside my comfort zone,
            and I am passionate about working hard to achieve my goals.
        </p>
        <p>
            I aim to understand the world of full-stack cloud computing
            in this course. I have never built a website before, as I only
            began learning about computer science after I started at
            Acadia University. I am eager to learn everything this course
            has to offer and dive deeper into a software developer's mindset.
            I am also excited to complete my academic journey at Acadia
            University, secure my Bachelor of Computer Science, and make
            my family and friends proud.
        </p>
